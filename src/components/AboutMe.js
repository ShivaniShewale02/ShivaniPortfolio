  Hi, I’m <span className="highlight">Shivani</span> — a passionate <span className="highlight">Full Stack Web Developer</span> and <span className="highlight">Software Developer</span> who thrives on turning ideas into impactful digital experiences. Whether it's crafting responsive user interfaces or engineering robust backend systems, I love creating meaningful solutions that make a difference.
  
  Driven by curiosity and creativity, I constantly seek to grow and take on new challenges. My journey in tech has been about more than just code; it’s about building, learning, and evolving every day.
